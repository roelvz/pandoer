# Pandoer

A multiplayer version of the classic Flemish card game called "Pandoeren". Created during the Corona-pandemic lockdown
of 2020.

## Used technologies

Most credit goes to the following technologies. They allowed me to mostly focus on the game logic itself.

* The superb [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/). Used for state management and multiplayer mode.
* [cardJS](https://github.com/richardschneider/cardsJS): for showing the cards.
* [React Playing Card](https://github.com/wmaillard/react-playing-cards): React version of cardJS.
* Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
